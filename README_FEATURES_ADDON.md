## India-wide Job Dataset & Smart Search

The seed data now generates 432 demo jobs across all 36 Indian States/Union Territories, with locations stored as `City, State, India`. This is based on the current Government of India's 28 states + 8 UT listing.

Search behavior:
- `India`, `All India`, or `Pan India` in the location field => all India-wide jobs.
- A state name such as `Maharashtra` => only jobs whose location is in Maharashtra.
- A city such as `Mumbai` => matching city jobs.
- Common state abbreviations such as `MH`, `UP`, `KA`, `TN`, etc. are supported.
- The main keyword box also understands location terms, so `Python India`, `React Maharashtra`, or `Java Delhi` work naturally.
- Search remains compatible with the existing filters, sorting, saved searches, and pagination.

## Latest update — Profile Edit + Guest Apply
- Added a real `candidate.edit_profile` Flask endpoint at `/candidate/profile/edit`.
- Existing profile data is loaded into the same complete-profile form for editing.
- Added Edit Profile access from the candidate dashboard, navbar, and profile page.
- Profile submit button changes to `Update profile` in edit mode.
- Job detail pages now show `Apply now` to logged-out visitors too.
- Logged-out Apply now sends the visitor to Login with the exact application URL in `next`; after successful candidate login, the application page opens directly.
- Logged-in candidates continue directly to the application form.
